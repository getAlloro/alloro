/**
 * Public website-contact route schemas (src/routes/websiteContact.ts).
 *
 * Two public, unauthenticated endpoints:
 *   • POST /api/websites/contact         — JSON contact form
 *   • POST /api/websites/form-submission — multipart generic form (multer)
 *
 * PERMISSIVE-FIRST and deliberately loose, for two reasons:
 *  1) Warn-only soak — surface real client shapes before any rejection.
 *  2) The /form-submission body is MULTIPART (multer) and `contents` may arrive
 *     as a JSON STRING that the controller parses itself; project resolution
 *     accepts EITHER `projectId` OR `hostname`. So neither is required at the
 *     schema level, and every shape is `.passthrough()`-ed so the anti-bot
 *     honeypot/timing fields (_hp/_ts/_jsc) and arbitrary form keys never
 *     trip a warn. Length caps mirror the controller + GbpInputSanitizer intent.
 *
 * REDACTION: the middleware logs field NAMES + issue codes only, never values —
 * so visitor-entered contact details never reach the logs.

/**
 * The three first-touch attribution fields, ENFORCED — the sanitizing subset.
 *
 * WHY A SECOND SCHEMA INSTEAD OF ENFORCING `formSubmissionSchema`:
 * this is a PUBLIC lead-capture endpoint. Flipping the whole form schema to
 * enforce would 400 a submission whose only sin is a long tracking parameter —
 * the practice loses a real patient inquiry to protect a metadata field. That
 * trade is never worth it. A lead is the asset; attribution is a note about the
 * asset. So we bound the note and ALWAYS keep the lead.
 *
 * Every field is `.catch(undefined)`, which makes this schema TOTAL: it cannot
 * fail, so parsing it can never reject a request. An out-of-contract value
 * resolves to `undefined` (absent) and the `sanitize` middleware drops it before
 * the controller reads it. A bad `source` does not take down a good
 * `utm_source` — each field catches independently.
 *
 * DROPPED, NOT TRUNCATED, on purpose. Truncating a 200-char label to 100 chars
 * would fabricate a label the visitor never sent, and truncating a URL would
 * have us classify a string we invented. Absent → the derivation reads
 * "unknown" and falls through to the next signal, which is true (Value #6).
 *
 * This schema is NOT a replacement for the closed allow-list / classifier in
 * sourceAttribution.ts — that stays the authority on whether a label names a
 * real channel. This is the type/length floor, enforced (§5.2, §11.2).
