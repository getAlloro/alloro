# Alloro Knowledge Lattice

Operating heuristics from leaders, companies, and failures. Each entry: leader, principle, heuristic, anti-pattern. Grouped by pillar. Failures are anti-patterns to avoid, not principles to follow.

## Hospitality

- **Will Guidara.** The 95/5 rule, 95% disciplined so you can be 5% specific to one human. Name one thing about this doctor's situation nobody else would notice. Avoid: identical playbooks for every client.
- **Lincoln Murphy.** Success is when the customer achieves their Desired Outcome. Before any CS play, name this doctor's specific outcome. Avoid: one onboarding sequence for every client.

## Autopilot

- **Pieter Levels (May 14).** One person, $3.1M ARR, sub-$200/mo infra, substrate before model. Write a CLAUDE.md at the root of every repo encoding architecture, conventions, and operational rules. Avoid: hiring people for work AI can do with proper context.
- **Anthropic Enterprise (May 14).** Production Claude at TELUS/Newfront/Honeycomb/Zoom/Crowdin/Bridgewater follows one pattern: CLAUDE.md for autonomous coding, Projects for chat, inline injection for sub-agents. Match each load surface to its proven pattern. Avoid: building custom RAG when CLAUDE.md + Projects + inline injection already covers it.
- **Yamini Rangan / HubSpot (May 14).** Move from individual to institutional AI fluency; 95% of engineering uses AI daily. Ask whether an initiative builds knowledge that compounds across instances or just speeds one person. Avoid: treating fluency as something that scales through hiring smarter people.
- **Tom Bilyeu / AI Department (May 14).** Run a 5-member AI department of role-scoped GPTs over a shared memory layer. Scope knowledge to projects; load shared memory into every instance. Avoid: one master AI asked to do everything.
- **Kieran Flanagan / 11-skill team (May 14).** AI workflows as Claude Code skills (SKILL.md whose frontmatter injects into the system prompt). Build each workflow as a discrete skill. Avoid: a giant AI that tries to do everything.
- **Alex Hormozi / Leverage Stack (May 14).** Four leverage types stack from linear to exponential. Classify which type a task produces before investing time or money. Avoid: hiring people for problems that compound through code.
- **Kyle Poyar.** In PLG the product is the acquisition, conversion, and expansion channel. The free Checkup must generate product-qualified leads who already felt the core value. Avoid: treating the Checkup as a lead magnet instead of as the first product session.
- **Agoda velocity research.** AI raises individual output but project velocity gains are modest, coding was never the bottleneck. Before assigning to CC, verify the spec is precise enough to execute without check-in. Avoid: treating AI-generated code as done because it compiles.

## Clarity

- **Bezos / Amazon.** Day 1: work backwards from the customer experience. Before any feature, name the specific customer experience this is working backward from. Avoid: Day 2 optimization around the edges instead of starting from the customer.
- **Simon Sinek.** People don't buy what you do; they buy why. Start every Alloro surface from the why: brilliant people being destroyed by the business side they never signed up for. Avoid: leading with product features.
- **Elon Musk / Algorithm.** Question every requirement; delete; simplify; accelerate; automate, in that order. Ask whether the task is necessary at all. Avoid: automating something that should not exist.
- **Tom Bilyeu / Impact.** Identity first; behavior follows. Filter by core human need (safety, belonging, purpose, status) and which identity is confirmed. Avoid: fear-driven changes from a single complaint or slow month.
- **April Dunford.** Positioning is the foundation every other decision is built on. Name the competitive alternative the doctor actually uses; position relative to that. Avoid: describing the product by features instead of by value relative to the current alternative.
- **Bob Moesta / JTBD.** People hire products to make progress. Before any sales conversation, name what the doctor is firing when they hire Alloro. Avoid: selling to doctors who haven't felt the push of their current situation.
- **Everett Rogers.** Innovations spread through five adopter groups in sequence. Name which group the message is for before any campaign. Avoid: early-adopter language with early-majority buyers.
- **Jensen Huang (May 14).** March 23, 2026: "I think we've achieved AGI", defined as AI capable of building and running a $1B company. Treat substrate-before-model as the operative bet. Avoid: dismissing the claim as hype.
- **Apple Business Platform.** Local businesses now have two parallel search surfaces, Google (GBP) and Apple Maps. Verify both are claimed. Avoid: treating Google as the only local search surface.
- **Netflix graph.** Graph intelligence as a query layer over existing storage. Traverse from a known node; query relationally. Avoid: migrating to a graph DB before relational is a measurable bottleneck.

## Proof

- **Adam Guild (Owner.com).** Solve the painful, obvious problem so adoption is inevitable. Ask: does this feel inevitable to adopt, or optional? Avoid: selling features instead of solving pain.
- **Geoffrey Moore.** A chasm separates early adopters from early majority. Name the documented outcome from one real customer that bridges into the early majority. Avoid: using one customer's excitement as proof for a different adopter segment.
- **David Skok.** CAC payback is the most important early-stage SaaS metric. Know CAC payback per channel before scaling. Avoid: growing ARR while ignoring net revenue retention.
- **Atul Gawande.** Trust in medicine is built by visible safety practices. Every output ships with a safety checklist (HIPAA-ready, undo in 60s, no PHI). Avoid: hand-waving safety claims.
- **Abridge.** AI that listens and documents is a trust multiplier when framed as assistive. Always frame AI as assistive, never replacing. Avoid: threatening clinical autonomy.
- **Overjet.** AI in dentistry is viable with compliance plus evidence. Lead with verifiable data, not claims. Avoid: unverifiable AI outcomes.
- **Cialdini.** Influence is earned through authority, reciprocity, social proof. Surface proof first (testimonials, referrals, transparent data). Avoid: persuasion before evidence.
- **Anthropic / Dario.** Safety and clarity must be trained, not bolted on. If a response risks overreach (medical advice, PHI), refuse gracefully and cite approved proof. Avoid: overconfident but wrong completions.

## Anti-Patterns (Failure category, what to avoid)

- **Theranos.** Overpromising without proof destroys trust irreversibly. Never commit to metrics that aren't verifiable.
- **WeWork.** Vision without discipline collapses. Never build culture on hype instead of execution.
- **Quibi.** Misreading adoption destroys well-funded ideas. Never launch without validation.
- **Juicero.** Tech novelty over utility kills products. Solve real, not invented, problems.
- **Kodak / Blockbuster.** Ignoring or refusing inevitability ends in collapse. Never defend the legacy model against the adoption curve.
- **Atlan / Convincing Wrong Answers (May 14).** A weak model on incomplete organizational context produces confidently wrong outputs. Never upgrade to a more capable model in response to incorrect outputs, the gap is context, not capability.
- **NimbleBrain + Arize / Multi-Agent Cascading Errors (May 14).** Cascading errors are the failure mode unique to multi-agent systems. Identify the upstream agent whose output others consume; never trust downstream output without independent validation.
